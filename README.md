# go-away

Self-hosted abuse detection and rule enforcement against low-effort mass AI scraping and bots. 

[![Build Status](https://ci.gammaspectra.live/api/badges/git/go-away/status.svg)](https://ci.gammaspectra.live/git/go-away)
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/git.gammaspectra.live/git/go-away.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/git.gammaspectra.live/git/go-away)

go-away sits in between your site and the Internet / upstream proxy.

Incoming requests can be selected by [rules](#rich-rule-matching) to be [actioned](#extended-rule-actions) or [challenged](CHALLENGES.md#challenges) to filter suspicious requests.

The tool is designed highly flexible so the operator can minimize impact to legit users, while surgically targeting heavy endpoints or scrapers.

[Challenges](CHALLENGES.md#challenges) can be transparent (not shown to user, depends on backend or other logic), [non-JavaScript](#non-javascript-challenges) (challenges common browser properties), or [custom JavaScript](#custom-javascript-wasm-challenges) (from Proof of Work to fingerprinting or Captcha is supported)

See _[Why?](#why)_ section for the challenges and reasoning behind this tool. 

This documentation and go-away are in active development. See [What's left?](#what-s-left) section for a breakdown.

## Features

### Rich rule matching

[Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://cel.dev/overview/cel-overview) is used to allow arbitrary selection of client properties, not only limited to regex. Boolean operators are supported.

Templates can be defined in the Policy to allow reuse of such conditions on rule matching. Challenges can also be gated behind conditions.

See the [CEL Language Definition](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md) for the syntax.

Rules and conditions are served with this environment:

```
remoteAddress (net.IP) - Connecting client remote address from headers or properties
host (string) - HTTP Host
method (string) - HTTP Method/Verb
userAgent (string) - HTTP User-Agent header
path (string) - HTTP request Path
query (map[string]string) - HTTP request Query arguments
headers (map[string]string) - HTTP request headers
   
Only available when TLS is enabled
   fpJA3N (string) JA3N TLS Fingerprint
   fpJA4 (string) JA4 TLS Fingerprint
```

Additionally, these functions are available:
```
Check whether a given IP is listed on the underlying defined network or CIDR
    inNetwork(networkName string, address net.IP) bool
    inNetwork(networkCIDR string, address net.IP) bool

Check whether a given IP is listed on the provided DNSBL
    inDNSBL(address net.IP) bool
```

### Template support

Internal or external templates can be loaded to customize the look of the challenge or error page. Additionally, themes can be configured to change the look of these quickly.

These templates are included by default:

* `anubis`: An anubis-like themed challenge.
* `forgejo`: Uses the Forgejo template and assets from your own instance. Supports specifying themes like `forgejo-auto`, `forgejo-light` and `forgejo-dark`.

External templates for your site can be loaded specifying a full path to the `.gohtml` file. See [embed/templates/](embed/templates/) for examples to follow.

### Extended rule actions

In addition to the common PASS / CHALLENGE / DENY rules, we offer CHECK and POISON.

CHECK allows the client to be challenged but continue matching rules after these, for example, chaining a list of challenges that must be passed. 
For example, you could use this to implement browser in checks without explicitly allowing all requests, and later deferring to a secondary check/challenge.

POISON sends defined responses to bad clients that will annoy them.
This must be configured by the operator, some networks have been seen to only stop when served back this output.
Currently, an HTML payload exists that uncompressed to about one GiB of nonsense DOM. You could use this to send garbage for would-be training data.

### Multiple challenge matching

Several challenges can be offered as options for rules. This allows users that have passed other challenges before to not be affected.

For example:
```yaml
  - name: standard-browser
    action: challenge
    challenges: [http-cookie-check, self-preload-link, self-meta-refresh, self-resource-load, js-pow-sha256]
    conditions:
      - '($is-generic-browser)'
```

This rule has the user be checked against a backend, then attempts pass a few browser challenges.

In this case the processing would stop at `self-meta-refresh` due to the behavior of earlier challenges (cookie check and preload link allow failing / continue due to being silent, while meta-refresh requires displaying a challenge page).

Any of these listed challenges being passed in the past will allow the client through, including non-offered `self-resource-load` and `js-pow-sha256`.

### Non-Javascript challenges

Several challenges that do not require JavaScript are offered, some targeting the HTTP stack and others a general browser behavior, or consulting with a backend service.

These can be used for light checking of requests that eliminate most of the low effort scraping.

See [Challenges](CHALLENGES.md#challenges) for a list of them.

### Custom JavaScript / WASM challenges

A WASM interface for server-side proof generation and checking is offered. We provide `js-pow-sha256` as an example of one.

An internal test has shown you can implement Captchas or other browser fingerprinting tests within this interface.

If you are interested in creating your own, see the [Development](#development) section below.

### Upstream PROXY support

Support for [HAProxy PROXY protocol](https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/blob/master/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) can be enabled.

This allows sending the client IP without altering the connection or HTTP headers.

Supported by HAProxy, [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/reverse_proxy#proxy_protocol), [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_proxy_module.html#proxy_protocol) and others.

### Automatic TLS support and HTTP/2 support

You can enable automatic certificate generation and TLS for the site via any ACME directory, which enables HTTP/2.

Without TLS, HTTP/2 cleartext is supported, but you will need to configure the upstream proxy to send this protocol (`h2c://` on Caddy for example).


### TLS Fingerprinting

When running with TLS via autocert, TLS Fingerprinting of the incoming client is done.

This can be targeted on conditions or other application logic.

Read more about [JA3](https://medium.com/salesforce-engineering/tls-fingerprinting-with-ja3-and-ja3s-247362855967) and [JA4](https://github.com/FoxIO-LLC/ja4/blob/main/technical_details/README.md).


### DNSBL

You can configure a [DNSBL (Domain Name System blocklist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_blocklist) to be queried on rules and conditions.

This allows you to serve harder or different challenges to higher risk clients, or block them from specific sections.

Only rules that match DNSBL will cause a query to be sent, meaning the bulk of requests will not be sent to this service upstream.

Results will be temporarily cached

By default, [DroneBL](https://dronebl.org/) is used.

### Network range and automated filtering

Some specific search spiders do follow _robots.txt_ and are well behaved. However, many actors can reuse user agents, so the origin network ranges must be checked.

The samples provide example network range fetching and rules for Googlebot / Bingbot / DuckDuckBot / Kagibot / Qwantbot / Yandexbot.

Network ranges can be loaded via fetched JSON / TXT / HTML pages, or via lists. You can filter these using _jq_ or a regex.

Example for _jq_:
```yaml
  aws-cloud:
    - url: https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json
      jq-path: '(.prefixes[] | select(has("ip_prefix")) | .ip_prefix), (.prefixes[] | select(has("ipv6_prefix")) | .ipv6_prefix)'
```

Example for _regex_:
```yaml
  cloudflare:
    - url: https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4
      regex: "(?P<prefix>[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+/[0-9]+)"
    - url: https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6
      regex: "(?P<prefix>[0-9a-f:]+::/[0-9]+)"
```


### Sharing of signing seed across instances

You can share the signing secret across multiple of your instances if you'd like to deploy multiple across the world.

That way signed secrets will be verifiable across all the instances.

By default, a random temporary key is generated every run.

### Multiple backend support

Multiple backends are supported, and rules specific on backend can be defined, and conditions and rules can match this as well.

This allows one instance to run multiple domains or subdomains.

### Package path

You can modify the path where challenges are served and package name, if you don't want its presence to be easily discoverable.

No source code editing or forking necessary!

### IPv6 Happy Eyeballs challenge retry

In case a client connects over IPv4 first then IPv6 due to [Fast Fallback / Happy Eyeballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs), the challenge will automatically be retried.

This is tracked by tagging challenges with a readable flag indicating the type of address.

## Example policies

### Forgejo

The policy file at [examples/forgejo.yml](examples/forgejo.yml) provides a ready template to be used on your own Forgejo instance.

Important notes:
* Edit the `homesite` rule, as it's targeted to common users or orgs on the instance. A better regex might be possible in the future.
* Edit the `http-cookie-check` challenge, as this will fetch the listed backend with the given session cookie to check for user login.
* Adjust the desired blocked networks or others. A template list of network ranges is provided, feel free to remove these if not needed.
* Check the conditions and base rules to change your challenges offered and other ordering.
* By default Googlebot / Bingbot / DuckDuckBot / Kagibot / Qwantbot / Yandexbot are allowed by useragent and network ranges.

### Generic

The policy file at [examples/generic.yml](examples/generic.yml) provides a baseline to place on any site, that can be modified to fit your needs.

Important notes:
* Edit the `homesite` rule, as it's targeted to pages you always want to have available, like landing pages.
* Edit the `is-static-asset` condition or the `allow-static-resources` rule to allow static file access as necessary.
* If you have an API, add a PASS rule targeting it.
* Check the conditions and base rules to change your challenges offered and other ordering.
* Add or modify rules to target specific pages on your site as desired.
* By default Googlebot / Bingbot / DuckDuckBot / Kagibot / Qwantbot / Yandexbot are allowed by useragent and network ranges.

## Why?
In the past few years this small git instance has been hit by waves and waves of scraping.
This was usually fought back by random useragent blocks for bots that did not follow [robots.txt](/robots.txt), until the past half year, where low-effort mass scraping was used more prominently.

Recently these networks go from using residential IP blocks to sending requests at several hundred rps.

If the server gets sluggish, more requests pile up. Even when denied they scrape for weeks later. Effectively spray and pray scraping, process later.

At some point about 300Mbit/s of incoming requests (not including the responses) was hitting the server. And all of them nonsense URLs, or hitting archive/bundle downloads per commit.

If AI is so smart, why not just git clone the repositories?


Xe (anubis creator) has written about similar frustrations in several blogposts:

* [Amazon's AI crawler is making my git server unstable](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2025/amazon-crawler/) [01/17/2025]
* [Anubis works](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2025/anubis-works/) [04/12/2025]

Drew DeVault (sourcehut) has posted several articles regarding the same issues:
* [Please stop externalizing your costs directly into my face](https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html) [17/03/2025]
  * (fun tidbit: I'm the one quoted as having the feedback discussion interrupted to deal with bots!)
* [sourcehut Blog: You cannot have our user's data](https://sourcehut.org/blog/2025-04-15-you-cannot-have-our-users-data/)

Others were also suffering at the same time [[1]](https://donotsta.re/notice/AreSNZlRlJv73AW7tI) [[2]](https://community.ipfire.org/t/suricata-ruleset-to-prevent-ai-scraping/11974) [[3]](https://gabrielsimmer.com/blog/stop-scraping-git-forge) [[4]](https://gabrielsimmer.com/blog/stop-scraping-git-forge) [[5]](https://blog.nytsoi.net/2025/03/01/obliterated-by-ai).

---
Initially I deployed Anubis, and yeah, it does work!

This tool started as a way to replace [Anubis](https://anubis.techaro.lol/) as it was not found as featureful as desired.

go-away may not be as straight to configure as Anubis but this was chosen to reduce impact on legitimate users, and offers many more options to dynamically target new waves.

### Can't scrapers adapt?

Yes, they can. At the moment their spray-and-pray approach is cheap for them.

If they have to start adding an active browser in their scraping, that makes their collection expensive and slow.

This would more or less eliminate the high rate low effort passive scraping and replace it with an active model.

go-anubis offers a highly configurable set of challenges and rules that you can adapt to new ways.

## What's left?

go-away has most of the desired features from the original checklist that was made in its development. 
However, a few points are left before go-away can be called v1.0.0:

* [ ] Several parts of the code are going through a refactor, which won't impact end users or operators.
* [ ] Documentation is lacking and a more extensive one with inline example is in the works.
* [ ] Policy file syntax is going to stay mostly unchanged, except in the challenges definition section.
* [ ] Allow users to pick fallback challenges if any fail, specially with custom ones.
* [ ] Replace Anubis-like default template with own one.
* [ ] Define strings and multi-language support for quick modification by operators without custom templates.
* [ ] Have highly tested paths that match examples.
* [ ] Caching of temporary fetches, for example, network ranges.
* [ ] Allow live and dynamic policy reloading.
* [ ] Multiple domains / subdomains -> one backend handling, CEL rules for backends
* [ ] Merge all rules and conditions into one large AST for higher performance.
* [ ] Explore exposing a module for direct Caddy usage.
* [ ] More defined way of picking HTTP/HTTP(s) listeners and certificates.

## Setup

go-away can can plaintext take HTTP/1 and _HTTP/2_ / _h2c_ connections if desired over the same port. When doing this, it is recommended to have another reverse proxy above (for example [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), nginx, HAProxy) to handle HTTPs or similar.

We also support the `autocert` parameter to configure HTTP(s). This will also allow TLS Fingerprinting to be done on incoming clients. This doesn't require any upstream proxies, and we recommend it's exposed directly or via SNI / Layer 4 proxying.

### Binary / Go

Requires Go 1.24+. Builds statically without CGo usage.

```shell
git clone https://git.gammaspectra.live/git/go-away.git && cd go-away

CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -pgo=auto -v -trimpath -o ./go-away ./cmd/go-away

# Run on port 8080, forwarding matching requests on git.example.com to http://forgejo:3000
./go-away --bind :8080 \
--backend git.example.com=http://forgejo:3000 \
--policy examples/forgejo.yml \
--challenge-template forgejo --challenge-template-theme forgejo-dark

```

## Development

This Go package can be used as a command on `git.gammaspectra.live/git/go-away/cmd/go-away` or a library under `git.gammaspectra.live/git/go-away/lib`

### Compiling WASM runtime challenge modules

Custom WASM runtime modules follow the WASI `wasip1` preview syscall API.

It is recommended using TinyGo to compile / refresh modules, and some function helpers are provided.

If you want to use a different language or compiler, enable `wasip1` and the following interface must be exported:

```
// Allocation is a combination of pointer location in WASM memory and size of it
type Allocation uint64

func (p Allocation) Pointer() uint32 {
	return uint32(p >> 32)
}
func (p Allocation) Size() uint32 {
	return uint32(p)
}


// MakeChallenge MakeChallengeInput / MakeChallengeOutput are valid JSON.
// See lib/challenge/wasm/interface/interface.go for a definition
func MakeChallenge(in Allocation[MakeChallengeInput]) Allocation[MakeChallengeOutput]

// VerifyChallenge VerifyChallengeInput is valid JSON.
// See lib/challenge/wasm/interface/interface.go for a definition
func VerifyChallenge(in Allocation[VerifyChallengeInput]) VerifyChallengeOutput

func malloc(size uint32) uintptr
func free(size uintptr)

```

Modules will be recreated for each call, so there is no state leftover.
